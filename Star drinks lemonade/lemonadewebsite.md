I built this lemonade website using only HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a clean and user-friendly design. HTML was used to structure the content, such as the order form, product descriptions, and images, while CSS handled the styling to make the site visually appealing and easy to navigate. Without using any JavaScript or backend code, the website provides a simple way for users to browse lemonade options and fill out an order form, relying entirely on the frontend layout and design to deliver a smooth ordering experience. This is an old website and not accesible from the internet.
