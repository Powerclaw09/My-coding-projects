💻 What I Code
I'm a creative developer who builds smart, interactive, and fun web-based tools — from bots that fix broken code to games that teach tech concepts. I like to take messy challenges (like totally wrecked HTML) and turn them into clean, functional, and user-friendly solutions.

🔧 My Coding Projects Include:
🤖 AI Chatbots
I build intelligent bots that answer coding questions, fix code errors, and explain programming concepts like a helpful tutor.

🧼 Code Cleanup Tools
I turn messy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into polished, standards-compliant code — automatically, with explanations with help from ai.

🎮 Web Games
I create classic  games and launch them to the browser using html, css and js I build stuff like rock papper scissor
 shoot and much more.

🌐 Interactive Websites
I design and build full pages with interactive buttons, and even weird experimental layouts just to test what’s possible.

💡 Learning Tools
I’m all about building tools that help others learn — like quizzes and coding sandboxes
