🤖 AI Chatbot: CodeBuddy
CodeBuddy is a smart, friendly AI chatbot designed to answer any coding question — even the weird, broken, or half-typed ones.

Originally created to clean up a heap of glitchy code (thanks, ChatGPT 😅), it now serves as a full-blown code assistant that helps developers fix bugs, understand tricky topics, and write better code from scratch.

🧠 What CodeBuddy Can Do:
💬 Answer Any Code Question
Whether it's HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or Python — CodeBuddy responds like a helpful teammate.

🪛 Fix Broken Code
Paste in messy, incomplete, or cursed code — CodeBuddy explains what's wrong and gives you a clean version.

📘 Explain Like You’re 10
Confused by addEventListener? Or this in JavaScript? It breaks it down clearly, step by step.

🧪 Test You with Challenges
It can quiz you, give mini coding problems, or help you prep for tests and interviews.

🛠️ Debug Mode
Drop in an error message — it’ll tell you what it means and how to fix it (no Stack Overflow diving needed).

🧨 Built From the Wreckage
CodeBuddy was born when ChatGPT threw out a code mess so bad, I had to build a bot just to fix it. That turned into a smart, funny, and actually helpful coding companion. Every glitch was a lesson. Every fix became a feature.

Now it helps others learn, debug, and level up — faster and with fewer tears. 😄
