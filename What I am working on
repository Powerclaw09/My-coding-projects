What I am currently working on:

I am building a website for KV West U, a summer day camp held at the West University Recreation Center. The site will provide detailed information about the camp’s programs, weekly themes, schedules, and activities designed for kids entering 1st through 5th grade.
           It will feature easy navigation, vibrant visuals, and clear sections to help parents and kids learn about registration, camp benefits, and how to get involved.
                  My goal is to create an engaging, user-friendly website that effectively showcases the exciting and enriching experiences offered at KV West U.
